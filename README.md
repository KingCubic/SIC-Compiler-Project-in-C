The provided code is a two-pass assembler implementation for a simplified instruction set, based on the SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer) architecture. The program processes an assembly file, generates a symbol table, calculates memory locations for each instruction, and produces machine code. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

Key Functions:
CalcLocctr: Calculates the location counter (locctr) based on the instruction or directive. It handles various directives like BYTE, RESB, RESW, and WORD. Errors are flagged for invalid instructions.
TestValidDir: Checks if a given directive is valid by comparing it against a predefined list of valid directives.
SymbolExists & addSymbol: These functions manage the symbol table. SymbolExists checks for duplicates, and addSymbol adds a new symbol to the table.
printSymbolTable: Prints the contents of the symbol table.
IsInstruction: Searches the OPTAB (Operation Table) to check if a given instruction exists and returns its opcode.
IsSymbol: Checks if a given operand is a valid symbol in the symbol table and returns its memory address.
printMRec: Prints the M records for modification, used in the second pass.
trimWhite: Trims whitespace from a string.
pass2: Implements the second pass of the assembler, which generates the machine code using the intermediate file created during the first pass.
Main: The main function reads the input file line by line, processes each line for directives, instructions, and symbols, and writes the intermediate file. It also manages error checking.
Error Handling:
The assembler performs various checks to ensure the validity of symbols, directives, and operands. Errors are printed with the corresponding line number for easier debugging.

Assembly Process:
First Pass:

Build the symbol table:
Determine the address of each symbol and instruction.
Write an intermediate file for use in the second pass.

Second Pass:

Generate machine code using the intermediate file and the symbol table.
Create modification records (M records) for relocatable programs.
